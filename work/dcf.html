                    <i>"In 2015, the Design Career Fair was launched by a group of design students. We saw potential in the Design Department to strengthen and grow in their career resources for students and post-grad opportunities. Starting from the bottom up, design students volunteered their time to build the Design Career Fair from its visual identity to employer relations base."</i><br><br>
                    As someone who has been with the Design Career Fair since its launch, I felt that it was important for the fair to be on a digital platform in order to become more prominent not only in Davis but to other places. This ultimately led to my involvement as a member of the web design team. (Pictured in Photo, left to right: Andy, Tara, me!, Alicia!), we were in charge of designing the website for the Design Career Fair (DCF). We all agreed that the website needed to be simple enough for future web team members to use and encompass the spirit of UC Davis' design community.

                    The website went through many different iterations before coming to the final design. We went presented each iteration to the whole team during the bi-weekly meetings asking for feedback to help us improve the site. We also collaborated with the graphics team to produce graphics that would help with hierarchy and emphasis.<br><br>
                    Because we had a team of five, we split up the work by doing 2-3 pages. We would then come together during our team meetings to look at the sketches. This led us to have good communication within the team and helped with the progression of the site as we neared the day of the Design Career Fair.

                    It was hard to condense the information we wanted to show in an app. Right now, there's still a lot of content and jargon that needs to be cut down. Our next steps would be to rearrange some of the content's hierarchy to further improve the user interface. On top of that, incorporating more resources and data would definitely help in bringing the user to a more accurate contact during specific situations.
