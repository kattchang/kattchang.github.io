                <span class="title">OBJECTIVE</span><br>
                    <p>Whaling has been a subject to intense debate over the years. As someone who feels strongly for animals and their rights, I knew this was a subject I wanted to touch upon. Along with designers Ashley Pae and Vivian Lee, we decided to come together and create a campaign for this cause.<br> 
                    This issue has sparked heavy discussion within the environmental community but isn't well known to the public.        Our main goal is to bring up the awareness against whaling through use of marketing strategies letting the audience know why whale lives matter.

                    <i class="subtitle">Research</i> In order to have a better understanding of campaigns worked, we each looked up two different campaigns to see what tactics were used. In my case I looked Dove's Realy Beauty Campaign targeted mostly towards women, and Amnesty International's Campaign on spreading awareness for child soldiers.
                    While these cases were pretty different from our topic, it helped us recognize how these cases were successful in their own right. As a consensus we decided to target our campaign towards college students.

                    <i class="subtitle">Branding</i> After much researching, we began by giving our campaign an identity. To start off, we sketched out our ideas and looked at one another's ideas and talked about what we liked. By the end of our discussion we were able to choose the qualities we wanted in our logo and put them together.

                    <i class="subtitle">Advertising Materials</i><br>Our advertising materials were made with the idea of designing for college students in mind. Because many college students get to campus by bus, this meant that bus stops would have the most traffic allowing students to at least get a glimpse of the poster. Since we live in the digital age, We designed a website that allows our audience to scroll through and read the information. A brochure was also created that can be passed around campus for students to pick up and read. </p>

                    I've realized that putting together a campaign requires a lot of research and effort. There's so many different aspects that you need to consider in order to put out a successful campaign. This campaign still has work to be done, but it has given me insight on what a full production project is like.
