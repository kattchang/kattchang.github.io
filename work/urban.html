                    We wanted to see if people knew what to do in situations where an animal is lost, injured or deceased. As I discussed the situation with my fellow peers, we noted most people didn't have clear knowledge in helping these creatures. It also appeared that there weren't many immediate resources. Moreover, when various websites did have information, they differed slightly in instructions which could cause confusion. Due to this variance, it would be time-consuming to look up the websites/resources in times of emergencies. This could deter the individual from helping the animal, or even lead to injury of the person or animal.
                    <br><br>
                    To tackle this problem, my group and I came up with the idea of making an mobile app. This would reduce the time for searching resources and would also serve to inform the public on ways to co-exist with the animals that share their homes.

                    In order to confirm our initial observations on people receiving lack of information, we conducted a survey to gather sufficient evidence.
