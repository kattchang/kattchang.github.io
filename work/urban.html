            <p>This will reduce the time needed to look for a solution in what could be an emergency. It is also to inform the public on ways to co-exist with the animals that share their homes. </p>
            <p>Davis is known to be an area that has a variety of different animal species. Unfortunately, when these animals are hurt, lost, or have passed away the citizens are uninformed as to how to help them. In order to combat this problem, I teamed up with fellow designers Darren Law and Vivian Lee to produce a solution to for this problem.
